                        <p style="font-size: 16px">Hi! I&apos;m Casey - the one that&apos;ll be bringing your surf brand to life in analog. <br><br>
                            Sure, there&apos;s a thousand ways to capture a product, an event, or a session - but the lure of analog is undeniably magical. It&apos;s why I started using film 8 years ago and never looked back. And who doesn&apos;t want to feel like they&apos;re jumping into a time machine while jumping into their new wetsuit? <br><br>
                            When you market in analog, you remind your audience of how this industry all began and how they can play a part in the larger surf story too. It&apos;s my job to find your unique sidequest in that story and create a set of images and videos that breathe life into it. It&apos;s the most rewarding thing, placing what was once just an idea, into the backdrop of a vintage ocean fairytale with your brand&apos;s unique fingerprint all over it.<br>
                            
                            Suddenly your brand stands in its own right as something your audience can visualize immediately. Whether you go for sunset colors and a blurred longboard tropical vibe, or stormy hues with more masculine shapes - let&apos;s figure out what your story is and tell it right.
                            <br><br>
                            Ready to get started?
                            
                            Let&apos;s channel my years of film storytelling experience and personal surfing experience into a visual story that will make your brand stand out.<br><br>
                            
                            <i>P.S. If digital is more your thing, or you want to sprinkle some between your film shots, I&apos;ve got you there too. Incorporating both brings two contrasting mediums together, letting the past and present sit side by side in a captivating visual display.
